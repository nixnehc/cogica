# Slogans

---


- idea/talk is cheap, give me your code!


- Bayes as lenses.


- van Benthem：「逻辑是心智的免疫系统。」


## Formal Argumentation

- The one who has the last word laughs best. [Dung, 1995] {FAT}





## Modal Logic
- From the PhD thesis (2005) of `Balder ten Cate`:
    1. modal logic $=$ first-order logic / bisimulations
    2. modal $\mu$-calculus $=$ monadic second-order logic / bisimulations
    3. tense logic $=$ first-order logic / two-way bisimulations

- From [Blue Book, 2001]:
    1. 
    2. 
    3.

## Mathematical Logic
- *Model Theory* $=$ *Algebraic Geometry*  $-$  *Fields*
