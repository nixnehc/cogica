## Slogans

- From the PhD thesis (2005) of `Balder ten Cate`:
    1. modal logic $=$ first-order logic / bisimulations
    2. modal $\mu$-calculus $=$ monadic second-order logic / bisimulations
    3. tense logic $=$ first-order logic / two-way bisimulations



- Model Theory $=$ Algebraic Geometry $-$ Fields
