- p. 283: the undecidability of FOL
- p. 285:
    > Modal logics of ***trees*** are harmless, modal logics of ***grids*** are dangerous!

    
- p. 295: `Elementary extensions` of *finite models* must be those models themselves.

- p. 300: "small is beautiful".

    
- p. 305: *the* **modal theory** of the **empty class** of frames is *the* **inconsistent** set of all formulas.

- p. 310: **Modal predicate logic** is a **product** of two modal logics.
    1. **Product logics** can be very unlike their components.
    2. Modal predicate logic requires a merge between two model-theoretic invariances:
        - *bisimulation* for worlds, and
        - *potential isomorphism* for the objects.
